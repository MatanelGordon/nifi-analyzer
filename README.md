Tired of not understanding why your Nifi sucks?

**New!** A TypeScript application that extracts processor information and performance metrics from Apache NiFi process groups and stores them in a SQLite database for analysis.

## Features

- üîç Recursively extracts processor information from all nested process groups
- üìä Comprehensive performance metrics collection and analysis
- üíæ Stores data in SQLite database with structured schema
- **LLM compatible** - `llm.md` can help Language Models create SQL queries for you.

## What Can I do with it?

- üîç Detect bottlenecks
- üìä create your own visualizations (not just "View Status History") using Datagrip, Apache superset, or maybe your own UI.

## Database Schema

The application stores information in multiple tables to enable detailed analysis:

### Core Tables

#### Processor Tables

- `processors_info`: Basic processor configuration and settings
- `processors_properties`: Processor-specific property configurations
- `processors_status_history`: Historical performance metrics

#### Connection Tables

- `connections_info`: Information about connections between processors
- `connections_targets`: Details about connection endpoints

#### Provenance Tables

- `provenance_events`: Records of FlowFile lifecycle events
- `provenance_events_attributes`: FlowFile attributes at event time
- `provenance_events_flowfile_relationships`: Parent-child relationships between FlowFiles

#### System Tables

- `nodes_info`: Information about NiFi cluster nodes

For detailed schema information, see [llm.md](llm.md).

## Quick Start

> **Note**: If you don't have a NiFi instance running, it's recommended to start a local one first. See [Local NiFi Setup](#local-nifi-setup-optional) for instructions.

### Requirements

- Node.js >= 20.0.0
- pnpm >= 8.0.0

### Running the Application

There are two ways to run this application:

#### 1. Web UI Mode (With Express Server)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start the server
pnpm start:server
```

#### 2. Script Mode

The script located in `src/script` directory accepts the following parameters:

- `--nifi-url` (`-u`): URL of the NiFi instance
- `--auth` (`-a`): Credentials in format `username:password`
- `--pg-id`: Process group ID to analyze
- `--provenance` (`-p`): Amount of provenance events to collect per processor (default: 100000, 0 to disable)

Examples:

```bash
# Analyze root process group
pnpm start:script --nifi-url https://localhost:8080 --auth admin:password

# Analyze specific process group with custom provenance events limit
pnpm start:script --nifi-url https://localhost:8080 --auth admin:password --pg-id abc-123-def-456 --provenance 50000

# Analyze without collecting provenance events
pnpm start:script --nifi-url https://localhost:8080 --auth admin:password -p 0
```

### Configuration via Environment Variables

The application can also be configured using environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `NIFI_URL` | URL of the NiFi instance | Yes |
| `NIFI_USERNAME` | NiFi username for authentication | Yes |
| `NIFI_PASSWORD` | NiFi password for authentication | Yes |
| `PG_ID` | Process group ID to analyze | No (defaults to root) |
| `DB_PATH` | Custom path for the SQLite database | No (defaults to ./data/output.db) |

### Local NiFi Setup (Optional)

Start and stop your preferred NiFi version using the provided scripts:

**For Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Start NiFi v1.28.0 (default)
./scripts/start-nifi.sh

# Start NiFi v2.2.0
./scripts/start-nifi.sh v2

# Stop all NiFi instances
./scripts/stop-nifi.sh

# Stop specific version
./scripts/stop-nifi.sh v1
./scripts/stop-nifi.sh v2
```

**For Windows:**
```cmd
# Start NiFi v1.28.0 (default)
scripts\start-nifi.bat

# Start NiFi v2.2.0
scripts\start-nifi.bat v2

# Stop all NiFi instances
scripts\stop-nifi.bat

# Stop specific version
scripts\stop-nifi.bat v1
scripts\stop-nifi.bat v2
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `NIFI_URL` - NiFi instance URL (default: `https://localhost:8080`)
- `NIFI_USERNAME` - NiFi username
- `NIFI_PASSWORD` - NiFi password
- `PG_ID` - Process Group ID to analyze (default: prompts for selection)
- `DB_PATH` - SQLite database path (default: `./data/output.db`)

### Process Group Selection

If `PG_ID` is not provided, the application will:

1. Fetch all root-level process groups
2. Present an interactive menu for selection
3. Allow choosing "Root" to analyze all process groups

## Analysis Examples

### Quick Start: Find the Slowest Processor

**LLM Prompt Example:**
```
"Find the slowest processors in my NiFi flow. Show me the top 10 processors with the longest execution times, including their names and types."
```

**Generated SQL Query:**
```sql
SELECT 
    pi.name AS processor_name,
    pi.type AS processor_type,
    MAX(psh.task_millis) / 1000 AS max_duration_seconds
FROM processors_status_history psh
JOIN processors_info pi ON psh.processor_id = pi.id
WHERE psh.task_millis > 0
GROUP BY psh.processor_id
ORDER BY max_duration_seconds DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This query will show you the top 10 processors with the longest execution times, helping you quickly identify performance bottlenecks.

**More LLM Prompt Examples:**
- `"Show me processors that are taking longer than 5 seconds to execute"`
- `"Find processors with high average lineage duration"`
- `"Which processor types are most common in my flow?"`
- `"Show me all InvokeHTTP processors and their performance metrics"`

### Performance Analysis

Find processors with longest execution times:

```sql
SELECT MAX(psh.task_millis) / 1000 AS duration, 
       pi.name AS name, 
       pi.type AS type
FROM processors_status_history psh
JOIN processors_info pi ON psh.processor_id = pi.id
WHERE psh.task_millis > 0
GROUP BY psh.processor_id
ORDER BY MAX(psh.task_millis) DESC;
```

Identify potential bottlenecks by lineage duration:

```sql
SELECT psh.processor_id,
       MAX(psh.average_lineage_duration) as average_lineage,
       pi.type,
       pi.name
FROM processors_status_history psh
JOIN processors_info pi ON psh.processor_id = pi.id
WHERE psh.average_lineage_duration > 0
GROUP BY processor_id
ORDER BY average_lineage;
```

Find load-balanced connections:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.name AS connection_name,
    src.name AS source_name,
    dst.name AS destination_name,
    c.load_balance_strategy,
    c.load_balance_partition_attribute
FROM connections_info c
JOIN connections_targets src ON c.source_id = src.id
JOIN connections_targets dst ON c.destination_id = dst.id
WHERE c.is_load_balanced = TRUE;
```

### Configuration Analysis

Get processors with high run duration:

```sql
SELECT name, type, run_duration, concurrent_tasks
FROM processors_info
WHERE run_duration >= 1000
ORDER BY run_duration DESC;
```

Get processor type distribution:

```sql
SELECT type, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM processors_info 
GROUP BY type 
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Notes:**

- Default credentials are used for development only
- Change default passwords in production environments
- Ensure NiFi instance is properly secured
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- The analyzer uses `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` to bypass certificate validation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**NiFi Connection Issues:**

- Verify NiFi is running and accessible
- Check credentials
- Wait for NiFi to fully start (2-3 minutes)
- Self-signed certificate warnings are bypassed automatically

**SQLite Errors:**

- Ensure write permissions to data directory
- Verify sufficient disk space
- Check that native SQLite libraries are available

### Development

**Prerequisites:**

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm
- TypeScript
- SQLite

**Scripts:**

- `pnpm start` - Run the analyzer
- `pnpm build` - Compile TypeScript

### Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**

- Default credentials are for development only
- Change default passwords in production
- Ensure NiFi instance is properly secured
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

2. **Edit TypeScript files** in your local `src/` directory
3. **Changes are immediately available** in the container
4. **Restart the analyzer** to pick up changes:
   ```bash
   docker compose restart nifi-analyzer
   ```
